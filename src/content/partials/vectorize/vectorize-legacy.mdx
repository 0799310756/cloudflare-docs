:::note[Using legacy Vectorize (V1) indexes?]

Please use the `wrangler vectorize --deprecated-v1` flag to create, get, list, delete and insert vectors into legacy Vectorize V1 indexes.

Please note that the creation of legacy Vectorize indexes will be blocked by December 2024. Other operations will remain functional.

Refer to the [legacy transition](/vectorize/reference/transition-vectorize-legacy) page for more details on transitioning away from legacy indexes.
